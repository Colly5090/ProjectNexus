# ðŸ“– E-Catalog Product Flow

This project implements a **category â†’ subcategory â†’ product drill-down flow** for an e-commerce product catalog.

Users can start from a **parent category** (e.g., _Electronics_), drill down into **children/subcategories** (e.g., _Laptops_), and finally view **products** (e.g., _Ultrabook_).
